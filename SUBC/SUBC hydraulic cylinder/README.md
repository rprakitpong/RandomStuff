I used SolidWorks to make this functional hydraulic cylinder as proof-of-concept. Since all market cylinders this small are pneumatics and has components that can rust (which possibly leads to leaking), this proves that it's possible to machine and buy parts that doesn't rust. 

Special thanks to Ray Brown <ray@sealum.com> for technical advice while designing this.
